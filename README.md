# Fyrn's Classic AddOns

No Twitch app for linux, even if I wanted to use it ðŸ˜¼

### Which AddOns **do** work?

Essentially: current retail addons specifically updated for Classic. The LUA interface is current, but the Classic client is missing any features introduced after 1.12.

For example: Bagnon/Ace is looking for void storage stuff that clearly didn't exist yet.
